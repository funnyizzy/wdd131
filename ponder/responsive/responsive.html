        <h2>Helaman 5:12</h2>
        <p>
          And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our
          Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your
          foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds,
          yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his
          mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to
          drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the
          rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation
          whereon if men build they cannot fall.

        <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
        <p>
          And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give
          unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient
          for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble
          themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak
          things become strong unto them.

          And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye
          would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these
          things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with
          real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it
          unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.
